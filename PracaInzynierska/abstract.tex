\chapter*{Abstract}
The goal of the thesis was to implement an evolutionary algorithm that optimises traffic lights on a junction. \\
Evolutionary algorithms are a category of artificial intelligence techniques. They are widely used to solve optimisation problems. Their main mechanisms are inspired by the evolution of species. \\
Traffic lights improvement was presented as an optimisation problem with a goal function dependant on a simulation of the traffic. Unity engine and C\texttt{\#} language were used to implement the application. It performs the optimisation process with settings provided by the user. This thesis describes the algorithm and the functionality of the application itself. The results of optimisation were presented in the form of charts. Possible directions for further extension of the application were also proposed.
